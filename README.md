### What I learned

This was a simpler project than the product card I did as my first guided attempt, however, I did this one entirely on my own. There were a few minor snags I found that I could not quite put my finger on as I hade a scroll bar appear on my page despite the content being centered. Turned out I accidently put a *margin* attribute on the *body* instead of *padding*. Other than that, it was nice to put into practice the CSS variables and some other tips I picked up on my previous challenge. This one was built completely on my own in a matter of 2 hours.
